        <p id="intro">I am currently a Computer Science student at CSU Fullerton expecting to graduate in May 2022. I
            enjoy
            learning about how to better use knowledge gained in my classes to create different full-stack projects that
            make
            life more convenient or entertaining. </p>

            <h3>SpaceVentureZ</h3>
            <img src="assets/SpaceVentureZ.png" alt="picture of SpaceVentureZ, a game I worked on" /><br>
            <p>
                SpaceVentureZ is a “shoot-em-up” style arcade game that will take players on a laser blastin' journey
                through our solar system to defeat vicious alien invaders.
                Featuring a classic top-down view as well as a robust weapon upgrade system, players will experience a
                retro, two-dimensional simulation with a modern twist!
                <br><br>
                This project was created for my Software Engineering class. Working in a group with 4 other peers over
                the course of an entire semester, we had the responsibility
                of designing and delivering a product which was broken into 5 iterations. Each iteration included
                planning, work distribution, design, development, and testing.

            <h3>Post Covid System</h3>
            <img src="assets/postcovid.png"" alt=" image of the rsvp page" /><br>
            <p>
                This project is a system that is meant to be a solution to the issues that Covid-19 brought to
                restaurants. It provides restaurants with a way to set up waitlists, take orders from customers, and
                also provides a way for customers to leave reviews about the restaurant and their services.
                <br><br>
                This project is web-based and was built with node.js.
